We look forward to building a new partnership with you. As discussed, here's a preliminary quote for <span class=\"highlight\">AIR TEAM intel, s.r.o.</span></p>\n\n        <p>We understand that you have other choices when seeking IT compliance and government solutions, and we thank you for considering us. We are committed to operational excellence and customer service, focusing on quality of service, clear communication, and simplification in providing the best solutions for your business.</p>\n\n        <p>Our mission at <span class=\"highlight\">{{doc.our_company}}</span> is to accelerate businesses like yours to become compliant, secure, and successful through our Unlimited IT Compliance as a service program.</p>\n\n        <p>Please let us know if this quote reflects everything we discussed and what you expected. If not, we can quickly revise it to reflect your needs. If the quote is on target, please proceed by digitally accepting the quote and processing payment.</p>\n\n        <b><p><span class=\"highlight\">{{doc.our_company}}</span> is a Registered Provider Organization (RPO) with the Cyber AB board. You may verify our status by clicking here.</span></p></b>\n\n        <p><span class=\"highlight\">{{doc.our_company}}</span> is also ITAR/EAR and DFARS-compliant company MSP. This compliance includes DFARS 252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. As part of being compliant with DFARS 252.204-7012, the company meets 110% of the 110 controls in NIST SP 800-171 (latest version) as well as the extra 20 controls required to become prepared for CMMC Certification at Level 3.</p>\n\n        <p>CMMC Certification at Level 2 is the mandatory minimum CMMC Certification preparedness level required to handle CUI or Controlled Unclassified Information. CUI Information has special and specific hardening requirements that a Prime or Subcontractor are required to meet properly store and transmit CUI information.</p>\n\n        <p>It is important to understand that many projects for the DoD require the Safeguarding of Covered Defense Information. Information such as building plans, blueprints, technical drawings, construction methods, measurements, tolerances, material lists, and even financial information can be considered valuable information to an adversary.</p>\n\n        <p>The number one threat to national security is information system attack (both physical information such as printed blueprints and digital information such as that held in the company's information systems). Because of this very real risk, the Department of Defense has mandated by law that those businesses which it does business with (spends money with) must meet the minimum requirements written into law in the DFARS or Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.</p>\n\n        <p>Thank you again for the opportunity to provide you with a quote. We look forward to exceeding your expectations.</p>\n\n        <p>Regards,</p>\n\n       <div class=\"letterhead\">\n        <div class=\"signature\">\n            <img src=\"/files/Logoblue.png\" alt=\"Signature\" />\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"contact-info\">\n            <p><span class=\"highlight\">{{doc.our_company_address.replace('\\n', '<br>')}}</span></p>\n            <p><span class=\"highlight\">{{doc.our_company_email}}<br>\n            Phone: {{doc.our_phone_number}}<br>\n            Mobile: {{doc.our_phone_number}}</span></p>\n        </div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n <!-- 3rd page start  -->\n<div style=\"page-break-before: always;
